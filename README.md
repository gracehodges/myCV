## Research Experience

**Assessing the impact of chemical treatments conducted on *A. Altissima* on *L. delicatula* populations**

*December 2023 - Current | Temple University, Ambler Field Station, Ambler, PA *

Creative Arts Research, and Scholarship Research Award ($4,000)

- Design an independent research project examining the impact of chemical treatments applied to Tree of Heaven (TOH) upon Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) populations 
- Develop an egg mass survey on ArcGIS Survey123 to quantify propagule pressure of SLF presence in focal locations.  
- Analyze samples from circle trap collection bags, practicing invertebrate identificaion using physcial and digital tools.  
- Conduct focal tree collection bag data management, cleaning, and analysis in RStudio  

This project utilizes a data science approach by conducting RStudio Analysis to assess the impact of chemical treatments applied to Tree of Heaven (TOH) upon Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) populations. Invasive species are increasingly prevalent, and understanding the dynamics of *L. delicatula* and it's interactions with the environment.     


**Assessing the impact of *L. delicatula* upon trees native to SE Pennsylvania**
*May 2023 - Current | Temple University, Ambler Field Station, Ambler, PA*

Spotted Lanternfly Project Field Technician 

- Maintain an array of semi-natural mesocosms for observation of impact of SLF on a series of trees and understory plants native to Pennsylvania
- Lead teams of technicians and interns into the field to conduct health assessment surveys and maintain circle traps placed on focal trees across two campuses.
- Collect detailed ecophysiological data on plants within the mesocosms, including soil moisture, chlorophyll content, water stress, leaf porosity, and visual health assessments
- Conduct site visits to Fort Indiantown Gap Military Base (FIG) while representing the Temple Ambler Field Station.  

**The Community Water Project**
*May 2021 – July 2021 | The College of Wooster Geology Department, Wooster, OH*

Community Water Project Research Fellow 

- Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to generate an initial draft of an Ohio Non-Point Source Implementation Strategy (NPS-IS) for a local watershed 
- Independently collect data using field equipment for the visualization of stream beds through cross sections and hydrological models 
- Utilize ArcGIS Desktop to edit data, conduct analysis, and create maps of focal locations 
- Conducted assessments of water quality, soil hydrology, tree-ring analysis, and environmental monitoring

**Greenhouse Technician**
*November 2019 – May 2022 | The College of Wooster Biology Department, Wooster OH* 

- Maintained care of several hundred Brassica rapa (B. Rapa) plant individuals 
- Precisely administered of hand pollination of B. rapa plants with mixed pollen loads 
- Conducted data analysis examining the female mate-choice of select pollen.
